Tabletop Simulator will not load from github, but I can still share my files here.

Maps
----

To get a map working and sized properly I create the "Custom Square" table because it's the largest and provide it with no image, any image will do.  To get the board sized properly for TTS you should create a "Custom Board" with the desired image then use the "Gizmo" tool to set the board "Scale Transform" to { 2.17, 1.00, 2.17 }.  This will make the inside of the game board equal to 3 feet by 3 feet.  Lastly I set the Position to { 0.00, 10.00, 0.00 } so that the board hovers over the table.
